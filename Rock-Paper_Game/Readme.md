# Rock Paper Scissors Game (Python)

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python.  
The game allows a user to play against the computer in continuous rounds.
The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissor, and the program determines the winner based on standard game rules.

# How the Game Works

- The user enters one of the following words:
  - Rock
  - Paper
  - Scissor
- The computer randomly selects one option.
- The program compares both choices.
- It prints the result:
  - You Win
  - You Lose
  - Tie
- The round counter increases after each turn.
- The game continues running in a loop.
